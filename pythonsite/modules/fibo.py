# Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. 
# Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module

# A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
# Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__

# Fibonacci numbers module
